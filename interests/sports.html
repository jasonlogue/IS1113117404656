                From a young age I've always enjoyed watching rugby. I found it very entertaining and that inspired me to start playing myself.
                At the age of 13 I started playing rugby with Old Christians Rugby Football club. I played with the club for five years while I was in secondary school
                and really enjoyed the physicality and comeradery of the sport. Currently I am playing with the UCC J3 team. We compete in the J3 league
                against other J3 teams in our area and the SSI league/Cup, where we play against othe colleges and universities throughout the country. 
                Playing rugby is a great way to spend the time that I'm not spending in college or working. I enjoy pushing myself and keeping fit
                and playing rugby is a great way to do this.
