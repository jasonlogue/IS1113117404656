    	            <p>I have travelled to Spain every year with my family for as long as I can remember. We go there on holidays every summer and also sometimes during Easter.
    	            We own a holiday home in the area of El Galan in Alicante, which is in the south of the country. I really enjoy visting the country every year as it's unique
    	            culture is very intriguing to me. I also enjoy experiencing the Spanish lifestyle and warm climate the country has to offer.</p>

    	                turquoise lagoon protected by a coral reef, itâ€™s known for its scuba diving.  It's also a popular luxury resort destination where some
    	                guest bungalows are perched over the water on stilts. Bora Bora is an aesthetically gorgeous place and I would love to visit there one day.</p>
