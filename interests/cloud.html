                <p class="aboutcloudpara">
                The definition of cloud computing is &quot;the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, 
                and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.&quot; In simple terms, cloud computing enables us to store our data 
                on the internet in the so-called &quot;cloud&quot; as opposed to using up memory on our own personal devices. This allows users to manage a much
                larger quantity of data and makes said data much more portable.

                    <p>While the term &quot;cloud computing&quot; was popularized with Amazon.com 
                    releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006, references to the phrase "cloud computing"
                    appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document.</p>
                    <br>
                
                    <p>The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original
                    ARPANET by as early as 1977, and the CSNET by 1981 &dash; both predecessors to the Internet 
                    itself. The word cloud was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape
                    was used to denote a network on telephony schematics.</p>

                    <p>After many years, cloud technologies finally went mainstream in 2016. For the first time, more than 50% of companies have adopted
                    some form of cloud technology.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>According to an IDC survey of 6,100 organizations in 31 countries, 68 per cent of organizations are now using public, private or
                    hybrid cloud in their IT operations. In 2015, only 48% had switched to the cloud. A substantial jump indeed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This trend has influenced thousands of CIOs to prioritize hosted computing and cloud data storage. They are approaching the shift 
                    as a progressive journey rather than a frenzied rush to outpace their competition. IT teams are updating their knowledge as well as hiring
                    experienced talent to help them integrate Cloud technology.</p>
