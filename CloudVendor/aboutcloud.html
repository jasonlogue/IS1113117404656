    <br>
        <p>Salesforce is the world's #1 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. The cloud-based applications for sales, service, marketing, and more don’t require
        IT experts to set up or manage — simply log in <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?locale=eu">here</a> and start connecting 
        to customers in a whole new way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud,
        Data Cloud (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud, App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As of early 2016, Salesforce was one of the most highly valued American cloud computing companies with a market capitalisation above $161 billion.
         In August 2017, Salesforce announced that it had reached the $10 billion revenue run rate becoming the first enterprise cloud company to do so.</p>
         <br>
         <p>The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing 
         in software as a service (SaaS). In June 2004, the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and 
         raised US$110 million. In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including 
         sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps. In October 2017, Salesforce would be launching Facebook Analytics tool for B2B marketers.</p>
