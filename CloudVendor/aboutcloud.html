            <p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS) &dash; <a href="https://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce:</strong></a></p>
            <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to
            customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as
            a service (PaaS).</p>
            <br>
            <p>SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates 
            the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. An exapmle of SaaS is Salesforce. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Salesforce is the world's no. 1 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. The cloud-based applications for sales, service, marketing, 
            and more don't requireIT experts to set up or manage &dash; simply log in <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?locale=eu">here</a> and start connecting 
            to customers in an entirely new and improved way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into multiple broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud,
            Data Cloud (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud, App Cloud, and IoT (Internet of Things) with 
            over 100,000 customers.

            <p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9">Cloud 9:</strong></a></p>
            <pPlatform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those 
            needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a 
            result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.</p>
            <br>
            <p>PaaS does not typically replace a business's entire IT infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services, such as application hosting or 
            Java development. A PaaS provider builds and supplies a resilient and optimized environment on which users can install applications and data sets. Users can focus
            on creating and running applications rather than constructing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services.</p>
            <br>
            <p>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a 
            code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, Python, PHP, 
            and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work 
            on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A massively important feature availabe to Cloud9 users is it's collaboration with popular platforms GitHub and Heroku. Users can connect their Cloud9 
            account to their GitHub accounts, where they can store the code they develop at each individual stage of development. This is made possible by the 'push feature'
            available with CLoud9. Once a user wants to save their work, they can 'push' their work to github where their entire project will be stored at that exact moment in time
            so that if they wish to go back and view their code from an earlier stage in the project they are free to do so. In conjuction with GitHub, Heroku can then 
            host the applications that the user develops using Cloud9. The user's Cloud9 account is connected to their Heroku account. Heroku then receives the code stored within the 
            users GitHub and can then run the application in real-time.</p>

            <p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon:</strong></a></p>
            <p>In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, 
            storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include detailed billing, 
            monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery.

            Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments,
            on a paid subscription basis. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all
            the time, through the Internet.

            <br>
            <p>
            AWS's version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware &#40;CPU&#40;s&#41; & GPU&#40;s&#41; for processing, 
            local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage&#41;, a choice of operating systems, networking, and pre-loaded application software such as web servers and
            databases.

            <p><strong>Communication as a Service (CaaS) - <a href="https://gmail.com">Gmail:</strong></a></p>
            <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such 
            communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications
            using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). CaaS allows businesses
            to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment
            and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.

            Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google. Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that 
            synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols. Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1, 2004, and ended its testing phase on 
            July 7, 2009.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            At launch, Gmail had an initial storage capacity offer of one gigabyte per user, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time. 
            Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can
            send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message.
