            <br>
            <p>Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. 
            It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft. SaaS is typically accessed 
            by users using a thin client via a web browser.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Salesforce is the world's #1 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. The cloud-based applications for sales, service, marketing, and more don’t require
            IT experts to set up or manage — simply log in <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?locale=eu">here</a> and start connecting 
            to customers in a whole new way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud,
            Data Cloud (including Jigsaw), Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud (including Chatter), Analytics Cloud, App Cloud, and IoT with over 100,000 customers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As of early 2016, Salesforce was one of the most highly valued American cloud computing companies with a market capitalisation above $161 billion.
            In August 2017, Salesforce announced that it had reached the $10 billion revenue run rate becoming the first enterprise cloud company to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing 
            in software as a service (SaaS). In June 2004, the company's initial public offering was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and 
            raised US$110 million. In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including 
            sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps. In October 2017, Salesforce would be launching Facebook Analytics tool for B2B marketers.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides 
            a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated
            with developing and launching an app.</p>
            <br>
            <p>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a 
            code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, Python, PHP, 
            and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work 
            on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Founded in 2010, and based in San Francisco and Amsterdam, Cloud9 IDE was a privately held company. Cloud9 IDE raised $5.5 million in Series A 
            funding from Accel Partners and product development software company Atlassian Software.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A massively important feature availabe to Cloud9 users is it's collaboration with popular platforms GitHub and Heroku. Users can connect their Cloud9 
            account to their GitHub accounts, where they can store the code they develop at each individual stage of development. This is made possible by the 'push feature'
            available with CLoud9. Once a user wants to save their work, they can 'push' their work to github where their entire project will be stored at that exact moment in time
            so that if they wish to go back and view their code from an earlier stage in the project they are free to do so. In conjuction with GitHub, Heroku can then 
            host the applications that the user develops using Cloud9. The user's Cloud9 account is connected to their Heroku account. Heroku then receives the code stored within the 
            users GitHub and can then run the application in real-time.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three
            main categories of cloud computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts 
            the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the
            virtualization or hypervisor layer.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can 
            include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
            CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
